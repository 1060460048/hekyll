_pronunciation: "heckle"_

Hekyll is a presentation generator that uses Jekyll and Impress.js to create awesome presentations. You write Markdown files, which get turned into individual slides for an Impress.js presentation.

## Design Goals

Hekyll should:

- Make it easy for hackers to write and graphically-impressive presentations in Markdown.
- Allow easier collaboration on these presentations through the power of GitHub.
- Allow users to commit and publish their presentations through GitHub through the power of GitHub Pages.
- Provide a good print stylesheet so that a user can Print to PDF when conferences ask for slide decks.
